Hi, I'm **Flora Gan**, and I'm a data scientist who somehow convinced people that staring at matrices all day counts as a real job.

I have a Master's in Data Science with a focus on AI from the University of Melbourne, plus a physics degree that I mostly use to sound intimidating at parties. (Just kidding—I don't go to parties. I prefer one-on-one conversations where I can properly interrogate... I mean, get to know people.)

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist specialising in computer vision, which means I teach computers to see things. It's like being an optometrist, but for robots.

My interests are what you might call "eclectic" or "couldn't decide on a major": physics, AI, philosophy (especially epistemology and ethics), sociology, and a bit of macroeconomics. Basically, I like analysing black boxes—whether that's understanding how humans think, why the universe works the way it does, or why my model just decided that wasn't a weld defect.

I'm driven by curiosity about the cosmos, a love of problem-solving, and an unhealthy need to understand *everything*. I also enjoy painting (when I can sit still long enough), the gym, and baking—because someone needs to balance out all this abstract thinking with bread.

My life philosophy? "You only live once—I won't shortchange myself." Which is why I'm planning to pursue a PhD in machine learning and physics once I sort out this whole permanent residency thing. Because apparently, one graduate degree wasn't enough suffering.

I value freedom, capability, and making myself proud (in that order... or maybe simultaneous order). I'm looking for work that actually gets used and makes a difference—turns out, watching your code collect dust in a repository is less fulfilling than advertised.

If you want to chat about deep learning, the nature of reality, why humans make terrible decisions, or literally anything that involves deep thinking and open exchange of ideas, I'm your person. Just don't expect small talk—I'm terrible at it.
